Welcome to the IngatSolat repository!
==========
IngatSolat is my attempt to create a Chrome extension to remind Singapore's Muslim users to pray! 


Why "yet another solat reminder app"?
-------------------------------------
The Chrome extensions I have tried either **lack an intuitive and nice-looking UI**, or **accurate timings for Singapore**.

The second issue has to do with the lack of an accurate and easy-to-use open-source API for Singapore prayer times.


What about IngatSolat?
----------------------
At its core, IngatSolat is simply a reminder tool that can also display the correct prayer times of the day without navigating to a separate menu.

How does it all work?
---
The IngatSolat application consists of the toolbar menu, and the configuration menu.

- Toolbar menu:
⋅⋅-The toolbar menu displays prayer times for the day, and on-click alarm settings. Alarms will trigger a browser alert.
- Configuration menu:
⋅⋅- The configuration menu has advanced settings, including offset settings for all or individual prayers. Settings will be stored in-browser i.e. in chrome.storage.sync object


Future plans
------------
In the future, I plan on expanding IngatSolat's features. Here's what I can think of
* Solat Streak - Encourage prompt and regular praying by checking in when you solat.
* Surau Search - Very low need
* More countries - display prayer times for other cities and nations
* IngatSolat Kids - A smartphone app that incentivises Muslim children to pray regularly
